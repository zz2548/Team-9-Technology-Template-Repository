# Component Architecture

This document defines the structure, requirements, and interactions of components in this system.

## What is a Component?
- Self-contained unit of functionality
- Has clear interfaces and dependencies
- Includes required tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Follows project coding standards

## Component Structure
Each component must include:
- Source code files
- Unit tests
- Documentation
- Integration tests with other components

## Current Components

### Calculator Component
- Purpose: Performs basic arithmetic operations
- Interface: Methods for add, subtract, multiply (we have also included division)
- Dependencies: None
- Events: Broadcasts calculation results

### Logger Component
- Purpose: Records operations performed by calculator
- Interface: Methods for logging operations
- Dependencies: Calculator Component
- Events: Listens to calculation results

### Notifier Component
- Purpose: Sends alerts for threshold breaches
- Interface: Methods for setting/checking thresholds
- Dependencies: Calculator, Logger Components
- Events: Sends notifications when thresholds exceeded

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Cover all public methods
- Test edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Example: Calculator → Logger (Mock Notifier)
- Example: Logger → Notifier (Mock Calculator)

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete workflow
- Example: Calculate → Log → Notify

## Creating New Components

1. Required Files
   - component_name.py (main implementation)
   - __init__.py
   - component/test/test_component_name.py
   - tests/integration/test_component1_component2.py 

2. Documentation Requirements
   - Usage examples
   - Dependencies list
   - Event interactions

3. Test Coverage Requirements
   - Minimum 90% code coverage
   - All public methods tested
   - Edge cases covered
